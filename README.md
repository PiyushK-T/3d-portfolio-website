# 3D Portfolio Website

Welcome to my 3D Portfolio Website! This project showcases my development and design skills through an interactive, animated, and responsive personal site.

Inspired by game character selection screens, the landing page features a rotating 3D interface where each "character" or element represents a section of the portfolio. This creative concept is aimed at making personal portfolios more engaging and visually memorable.
