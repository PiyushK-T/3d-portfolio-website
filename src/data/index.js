      using the COCO-2017 dataset. This project focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess textual 
      data and employed algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Classification, and Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes for training 
      and optimization. The goal was to enhance understanding of customer sentiment in a dynamic industrial context, aiming to improve operational

      diverse meteorological data and utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms to address class imbalances 
      and achieve accuracies between 78% and 86%. Our goal was to enhance weather forecasting accuracy and provide actionable insights for 
      weather-sensitive sectors. Future work includes refining models, adding relevant features, and exploring advanced techniques for even
